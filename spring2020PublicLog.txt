Notes from 27 JAN 2020

Assigned homework due Monday, a week from today.
Discussed project one, making a pong game in NDC,
but have not set a due date, as I have not yet implemented
it myself, which I will do before assigning any projects.
Told everyone about getting modelviewprojection up
and running on their home machines, as it is ungraded homework,
but people need to be able to run these programs on their own machines,
or in the lab, which has the requisite software (Visual Studio 2019
with Python Extension.)
Multiple people joined the slack channel for group
communication.
Discussed method chaining, how it works.  minimizes
naming one-time use variables.  Method chaining is used
for a simple version function composition, to introduce
the concept which later is turned into the lambda stack, and
then the matrix stacks.
Showed "Minecraft" in python, Craft in C, and McNabber's
OpenGL demos, to show what type of stuff is able to be done
with OpenGL.  Any of these projects can be a basis for their
final paper, which involves studying open source graphics code,
modifying it, or just doing a write-up of what they independenly
learned).
Showed the mvpvisualtion demos to show the endgame of where
modelviewprojection project is going, in order to motivate
while going through demos, towards adding motivation towards
understanding the intro material.
Demos the 3 scripts which try to rotate, but glossed over
the details due to time.  Go into the details of the math.
Did not cover demo05 onwards through camera management as I thought
I would, but that's ok, because the demos and history of graphics
(Crash Bandicoot vs Mario 64, the z-buffer, and the moving cameras)
was worthwhile.

Notes from 22 JAN 2020
 -Covered up to Demo06.  Update lesson 6 regarding Global Space (as I didn't explain what that meant, I just covered NDC)
 -Redo Demo6.  Repetition is good but slow down.  Don't let speed through the repetitive parts make me go to fast on the new parts
