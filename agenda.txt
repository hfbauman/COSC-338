Agenda 03 FEB 2020

Rego-over 2D rotations.  The following link covers them
from a trigonometry point of view
https://www.alanzucconi.com/2016/02/03/2d-rotations/

- go over demo 11 - 16.  Covering a square relative to a paddle.
  continue explaining camera space and how to think about that
  differently.
  introduce the z axis, and rewrite the demos in 3D mode.
  Code will show that objects drawn later in the event loop
  overwrite existing objects in the framebuffer.  Later demos
  fix that by introducing a depth test.
  We will cover ortho, which puts any arbitrary rectangular
  prism into NDC, and try making a 3D camera which doesn't
  work well because it uses ortho.  Will fix that with a
  later demo which takes the z distance into account,
  to make further away objects appears smaller

- cover blocking vs non-blocking io. Describe how you are using tail.



Material to be covered at unknown date that may not be covered in the book:
Subset of linear algebra
  - matrix multiplication
  - inverses
  - dot product
  - cross product
  - right hand rule
  - viewing matrix multiplication front to back vs back to front
  - tree of transformations from a top level space
  - perhaps RREF
  - perhaps A=CDR to demonstrate row space vs column space,
    as well as being useful towards projecting geometry for
    the shadow section of the OpenGL Superbible v4, old testament.
Debugging
  - gdb for C code (build Craft in debug mode using CMake)
  - pdb for python
  - how to use
     - set breakpoints
     - step line
     - step in
     - step out
